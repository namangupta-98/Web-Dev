  <h3>Projects</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>Document Scanner & Image enhancer Application (Sept 2019)</strong> <br>
      <p>An application which can detect document and crop them from input image and further enhance it to imporve image quality.</p>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Data Delivery Drones (June 2019 - July 2019)</strong> <br>
      <p>As agriculture struggles to support the rapidly growing global population,plant disease reduces the production and quality of
        food, fiber and biofuel crops. Farmers spend billions of dollars on disease management, often without adequate technical
        support, resulting in poor disease control. So, we came up with a solution, Data Delivery Drones. These autonomous drones
        scan whole fields for any plant diseases using powerful deep learning models running on the cloud and inform the farmers
        accordingly, providing them with the suggestions on how treat them. </p>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Security Surveillance System (Dec 2018 - Jan 2019)</strong> <br>
      <p> Application to deal with the issue of surveillance with the proactive usage of network of cameras, coupled with the
due models of deep learning to make them smart and self-capable to detect and monitor suspicious activities in the area of
reference. Connected public and private CCTVâ€™s to build a secure and accurate web for surveillance. An automated SMS API
system to deliver the whereabouts of the vehicle to its owner on mobile phone. Development involved usage of Machine
Learning, Python Socket, Virtualization, Deep Learning and AI.  </p>
